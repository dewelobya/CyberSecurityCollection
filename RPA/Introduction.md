## What kind of benefits does RPA provide for organizations?

RPA benefits organizations by improving its:
- Process
- IT
- Workflow
- Infrastructure
- Back-office operation 

RPA especially eliminates manual tasks, such repetitive tasks are done quickly and accurately enabling employees to focus on more satisfactory higher value initiatives, reasoning and judgement - based decision-making. 

ROA boasts a rewarding ROI, it reduces human connection, exchange of critical information and data remains secure. RPA elevates security by guarding against unauthorized access and threats. 

## What is the difference between "dummy " RPA and cognitive automation according to the text? 

"Dummy" RPA are simplest form of RPA, where RPA robots cannot by default conduct procedures involving judgement and require defined rules and organised data to function. 

Cognitive automation, which seamlessly combines rule-based automation with machine-learning algorithms and the analysis of unstructured data, is at the other extreme of the RPA spectrum.

## How would you describe the elements of a potential RPA use case? 

A potential RPA use case should involve repetitive and rule-based tasks, high-volume transactions, data-driven processes, manual tasks, low exception rates, and a clear ROI. By identifying and automating such tasks, organizations can achieve significant time and cost savings, reduce errors, and improve operational efficiency.

1. Repetitive and rule-based tasks: RPA is most effective for automating repetitive and rule-based tasks. These are tasks that follow a set of defined rules and are performed in a standardized way.

2. High-volume transactions: RPA is most effective when used for high-volume transactions. These are tasks that are performed frequently and involve a large number of transactions.

3. Data-driven processes: RPA is most effective when used for processes that involve structured data. This includes tasks such as data entry, data validation, and data extraction.

4. Manual tasks: RPA is most effective when used for tasks that are currently performed manually. This includes tasks such as copying and pasting data between systems, filling out forms, and sending emails.

5. Low exception rate: RPA is most effective when used for tasks that have a low exception rate. These are tasks that are performed in a predictable and consistent manner and have a low rate of errors or exceptions.

6. Clear ROI: A potential RPA use case should have a clear return on investment (ROI). This means that the benefits of automating the process should outweigh the costs of implementing and maintaining the RPA solution.

## Describe the typical matrix that is used in organizations to help in choosing potential candidates for RPA. What are the "low hanging fruits" in such matrix?

The typical matrix used in organizations to help choose potential candidates for RPA includes several factors that are evaluated to determine which tasks or processes are the best candidates for automation. 

complexity 
repetitiveness
volume
error rate 
standardization 
time-consuming
cost 
"Low hanging fruits" in such matrixes mean that tasks or processes are simple, repetitive, and involve a high volume of transactions. These kinds of tasks are easy to automate and the results are immediate such as cost savings and efficiency gains. For example, data entry, invoice processing, and customer service tasks. 

## Explain the difference between attended and unattended robots.

The differences lie in how they are used and controlled. Attended robots are robots that work alongside human employees and require human input and supervision. They are usually triggered by specific events or tasks. The employee can trigger the robot to perform the task, and the robot may require input from the employee at certain points during the process. For example, an attended robot may be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry on an employee's computer. 

Unattended robots operate independently of human supervision. They are typically used to automate back-end processes that do not require human interaction. For example, an unattended robot may be used to automatically process invoices in a finance department. The robot can access multiple systems and perform various tasks without human intervention.



Further, the main differences between attended and unattended robots are: 

1. control: attended robots are controlled by humans and require human input and supervision. Unattended robots are fully automated and operate independently without human supervision.

2. interaction: attended robots require interaction with humans at certain points during the process. unattended robots operate independently without human interaction.

3. use cases: attended robots are typically used for tasks that require human supervision and input, while unattended robots are typically used for back-end processes that can be fully automated.

4. deployment: attended robots are typically deployed on employee desktops, while unattended robots are deployed on servers or virtual machines.
