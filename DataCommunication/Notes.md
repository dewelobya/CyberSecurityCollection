**Data transmission**

Data communication or digital communications, including data transmission and data reception, is the transfer and reception of data in the form of a digital bitstream or a digitized analog signal (A.P.Clark 1983) transmitted over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel.

**Topology**

- Ring 
- Mesh 
- Star
- Fully Connected 
- Line
- Tree
- Bus

**Transmission methods**

- Anycast
- Broadcast 
- Multicast 
- Unicast
- Geocast


- Simplex
- Half Duplex
- Full Duplex (now also wire network/langalliset verkot)

**Network appliances**

- Repeater (Toistimet)
- Keskittimet, HUB, moniporttitoistimet 
- Bridge (Sillat)
- Switch (Kytkimet)
- Router (Reitittimet) 
- Firewall (Palomuuri)
- NGFW (DPI & IPS) = next generation firewall with deep packet inspection and intrution prevention system

- Protocol = connection policy = traffic procedure 
- A protocol is a set of rules that two or more devices must follow in order to allow communication between them.
- The role of protocols is to work together to provide a data transfer protocol service to application processes.

**Protocols p2**

- TCP/IP
*The most used and common
- NetBEUI
*IBM & Microsfot (1985)
- IPX/SPX
*Novell Netware (1983)
- Appletalk 
*Apple appliances (1984-2009)
- DECnet
*Digitalin VAX-machines (1975; 1983-2010)

**TCP/IP p1**

- Data transfer is a family of protocols that includes several different types of protocols/ Tiedonsiirto on protokollaperhe, johon kuuluu useita erilaisia protokollia
- TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
- IP = Internet Protocol
- UDP = User DatagramProtocol
- ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol
- ARP = AddressResolutionProtocol
- IGMP = Internet Group Management Protocol
