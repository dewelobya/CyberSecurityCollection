### Verify resources created 


Once the deployment is created, you can verify that Azure created not only a VM, but all of the associated resources the VM needs.

- Select Home
- Select Resource groups
- Select the learn-5f6f6520-1231-4cf4-ab52-6caae1bdaa2c resource group

### Clean up 

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that you leave running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
